ULTRATHINK

You are a senior frontend architect and UI designer (15+ years). Create a modern, high-impact landing page that feels premium, real, and production-grade (not a template, not AI filler). The page must build trust immediately and make users want to use the tool now. It’s a new financial product, so clarity and credibility are non‑negotiable. The experience must be consumable by both experts and beginners.

Before designing, read and follow these sources of truth:
- /Users/tony/Developer/projects/NSECalculator/docs/ui-ux-rationale.md
- /Users/tony/Developer/projects/NSECalculator/.github/prompt2.md
- /Users/tony/Developer/projects/NSECalculator/.github/copilot-instructions.md
- /Users/tony/Developer/projects/NSECalculator/docs/nse-fee-calculator-spec.md (authoritative)

Hard constraints:
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only. No React/Vue/Angular/Next. No CSS frameworks.
- No backend, no auth, no analytics beyond Plausible/Umami.
- Preserve functionality. Do not break or remove existing calculator logic.
- Respect performance budgets and no external requests on first load.
- Keep the “Calm Fintech” visual system (trustworthy, restrained, data-first).

Design goals:
- No generic layouts, no template look, no “AI slop.”
- Strong, intentional typography and hierarchy.
- Clear visual flow from hero → calculator → proof/trust → education.
- Make the value proposition feel instantly credible and specific to NSE / Kenyan investors.
- Use depth, spacing, and rhythm to make complex data feel approachable.

Deliverables:
- Provide the updated HTML/CSS/JS needed for the landing section (and any supporting sections you add).
- Include concise rationale for key layout and copy decisions.
- Ensure mobile-first responsiveness and accessibility (WCAG AA).

Tone:
Direct, confident, precise. Prioritize trust, clarity, and real-world usefulness over marketing hype.
